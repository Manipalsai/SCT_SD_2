#  SCT_SD_Task2 – Number Guessing Game

This repository contains **Task 2** for my **Software Development Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.

---

##  Task Objective

Create a program that generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it.  
The user must input guesses until they find the correct number, with hints given for each attempt.  
The goal is to demonstrate basic use of **random number generation** and **Tkinter GUI**.

---

##  Key Features

- Generates a random number between **1 and 100**.
- User-friendly **Tkinter GUI** to input guesses.
- Displays helpful hints: **Too high**, **Too low**, or **Correct!**
- Counts the number of attempts and shows a success popup.
- Handles invalid input gracefully.

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** (built-in Python GUI library)
- **random** module

---

##  Requirements

 This program uses only built-in Python modules (`tkinter` and `random`),  
so you don’t need to install anything extra.

---

##  How to Run

1️⃣ Make sure you have **Python 3** installed.
